#Investigating choice chambers and insect habitats

In this lesson we will investigate what colour habitats are preferred by different insects.

##Learning objectives

- To plan and carry out an investigation Investigating choice chambers and insect habitats

##Learning outcome

##All students are able to

- Handle insects carefully
- Understand that investigations using insects have to be carried out with consideration for the health of the insect

##Most students are able to 

- Plan an investigation to find out what colour habitats are preferred by different insects.
- Interpret results from choice chamber experiments

##Some students are able to

- Evaluate the ethics behind using insects in experiments

##Lesson Summary

- During this lesson students will collect various insects (carefully) from around the school site and use them to find out if they are attracted to different colour lights sources.


##Starter

- Hold a short class discussion on the use of animals and insects in science experiments.  Identify a common set of rules that everyone should follow when using live insects during experiments.
- Involve pupils in the process of agreeing any precautions for the activity and discuss risks.


##Main development

##The Data Logger

- To access the resources for this investigation.

From LXTerminal type: `sudo python3 respiration.py` 

##Carrying out the experiment

- Collect your insect species and place them into a sealed clean petri dish.  Ensure that you have suitable water and vegetation for the insect you will be studying,
- Place the petri dish on top of the LED matrix.  
- Place the Raspberry Pi camera above the LED matrix pointing down towards the insects.
- Start the program choice_chambers.py
- The LED matrix will cycle through the following colours.  After thirty seconds to allow the insects to settle the camera will take two photos 5 seconds apart.

Colour patterns

- 100% white
- 50% white and 50% off
- 25% white and 75% off
- 100% red
- 50% red and 50% off
- 25% red and 75% off
- 100% blue
- 50% blue and 50% off
- 25% blue and 75% off
- 100% green
- 50% green and 50% off
- 25% green and 75% off
- 50% green and 50% blue
- 50% green and 50% red
- 50% red and 50% blue


##Analysis of the results

- Open the folder containing science_task6.  There will be two photos taken with each experiment.
- Produce a tally chart to count how many insects are in section from the photos.
- Is there sufficient results to identify a clear pattern?

##Plenary 

- Is it possible to write a valid scientific conclusion based on the observations recorded?

##Extension

- Edit the code to change the patterns / colours used.
- Does the insect make a difference?

##Risk assessment

- Please read relevant local documentation about handling insects in school classrooms. Students should wash their hands after completing each experiment.

In addition the following risks should be considered.

- Pupils and teachers may experience an allergic reaction – contact with fur and feathers are known to induce an allergic reaction in some people.
- Bites and stings from insects.
- Animal welfare.

Suitable control measures could include.

- Identify any pupils with medical conditions, including those with respiratory problems and allergies.
- Ensure inhalers are readily available.
- Warn pupils about hand, eye and mouth contact when handling creatures.
- Any pupil or adult with an open cut on their hands, with infected cuts or suffering from an infection, must not handle the animals or come into contact with them.
- Collect small creatures for study using a pooter or a paintbrush to avoid harming them.
- Return small invertebrates collected from the environment as soon as possible.
- Pupils and adults must wash their hands after touching insects.
