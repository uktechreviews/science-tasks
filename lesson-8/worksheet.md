#Investigating choice chambers and insect habitats

In this lesson we will investigate what colour habitats are preferred by different insects

##Theory 

Different insects prefer different places or habitats to live.  Over time it is possible to track changes in insects as they have become adapted to survive in different areas.
During this investigation we will investigate if the colour of light influences the movement and position of woodlice, beetles or maggots.

##Experiment  

- Collect your insect species and place them into a sealed clean petri dish.  Ensure that you have suitable water and vegetation for the insect you will be studying,
- Place the petri dish on top of the LED matrix.  
- Place the Raspberry Pi camera above the LED matrix pointing down towards the insects.
- Start the program choice_chambers.py
- The LED matrix will cycle through the following colours.  After thirty seconds to allow the insects to settle the camera will take two photos 5 seconds apart.

Colour patterns

- 100% white
- 50% white and 50% off
- 25% white and 75% off
- 100% red
- 50% red and 50% off
- 25% red and 75% off
- 100% blue
- 50% blue and 50% off
- 25% blue and 75% off
- 100% green
- 50% green and 50% off
- 25% green and 75% off
- 50% green and 50% blue
- 50% green and 50% red
- 50% red and 50% blue

##Extension

- Edit the code to change the patterns / colours used.
- Does the insect make a difference?
