#Investigating aerobic respiration during exercise

In this lesson you’re going to investigate the changes to your exhaled breath during aerobic respiration.

##Theory 

During aerobic respiration the stored energy in food is released in a chemical reaction.
The equation for this reaction is:

Glucose + Oxygen = Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy

##Experiment  

1. The Sense Hat has a temperature and humidity sensor built into it. 
1. The humidity sensor can measure how much water there is in the air.
1. Your teacher will demonstrate how to setup the Raspberry Pi for this experiment.
1. When you are ready start the code by pressing the button on the Sense Hat. 
- The LED matrix will turn blue
- Blow into the straw until it turns yellow
- Jump on the spot 
- As soon as the LED turns blue again blow into the straw until it goes off 
1. Record the temperature at the start and end in your note book.
1. Record the humidity at the start and end in your note book. 
1. Calculate the change in temperature by subtracting the end temperature from the start temperature. 
1. Calculate the change in humidity by subtracting the end humidity from the start humidity. 
1. Write a sentence to explain what has happened to the humidity and temperature during the experiment. 
1. Use the equation for respiration to explain why the results have changed after doing the exercise. 

##Extension

How could you adapt the experiment to investigate the respiration of plants in the dark or to see if other living things such as maggots respire?
