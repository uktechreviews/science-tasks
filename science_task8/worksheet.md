#Investigating stopping distances of cars

In this lesson you will measure your reaction time and use it to investigate the effects of distractions on your driving

##Theory 

The stopping distance of a car is made up of two components, the thinking distance and the braking distance. You can calculate the stopping distance by adding together the thinking distance and the braking distance.

- The thinking distance is the distance the car will travel while you react to a stimulus such as the cars infront of you putting on the breaks.
- The braking distance is affected by factors such as road conditions and the quality of tyres and brakes on the car.

In this experiment you will measure the time it taskes to react to a stimulus and the Raspberry Pi will calculate how far you would have travelled in the time taken at different speeds.

##Experiment  

- The class teacher will start the code and enter the number of students in the class.
- Your teacher would have entered a speed limit such as 70 mph (a Motorway or fast dual carriage way)
- Enter your name when prompted on the screen.
- Press the enter key or the button the Sense Hat when you are ready to start.
- The green traffic light will come on between 3 and 10 seconds.
- As soon as you see the red traffic light appear either press the button on the Sense Hat or the enter key on the keyboard.
- Your result will be logged.
- Make a note of how quick your time was and how far you would have travelled.
- Are you surprised about how far you travelled in that time period?

##Analysing results

sing a suitable spreadsheet import both sets of data and produce a bar chart graph comparing the results from the class.  

Instructions using Google Sheets

- Log into Google Sheets and start a new sheet

- Import your results. The pipe symbol | has been used to separate each column of results.

- You will now need to tidy up your results by adding column heading

- Highlight the name, reaction time and distance columns and insert a new chart

- Select a suitable bar chart and add it to you document.

##Extension

- The same program can be used to investigate different factors that might affect your stopping distance.
- Run the program again and enter the number of attempts you would like to investigate.
- Instead of entering a student name enter a description of your distraction.
- Some distractions could include:

- having a conversation with a friend as you carry out the test
- do it at the end of a school day when you are tired
- try sending a text with the other hand at the same time
- try listening to loud / fast / quiet music
- try reading from a sheet of paper or looking at a map
