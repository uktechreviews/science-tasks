#Investigating 

In this lesson you are going to investigate how the colour of a surface affects the absorption of IR radiation.

##Theory 

Different colour surfaces absorb different amounts of Infra Red radiation.  During this practical we will find out which colour surfaces absorbs the most radiation.

##Experiment  

1. Wrap a Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat in black paper.
1. Place the table lamp on a heat-proof mat and position a table lamp 30cm away from it.
1. Start the code and enter a suitable filename for the results.
1. Enter the number of results required and the interval between each measurement.
1. Switch on the table lamp and press enter on the keyboard (or the button on the Sense Hat)
1. Once the results have been collected they will be written to a file which can be analyzed with Excel.
1. Replace the black paper with silver foil and repeat the steps above.

Plot a graph of temperature against time for the both set of results.  Which material absorbed the most infra red radiation?
